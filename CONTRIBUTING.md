### Git commits

Try to write somewhat clean changes.  To cite [Tom Lord][tla]:

> #### Using commit Well -- The Idea of a Clean Changeset
>
> When you commit a set of changes, it is generally "best practice" to
> make sure you are creating a clean changeset.
>
> A clean changeset is one that contains only changes that are all
> related and for a single purpose. For example, if you have several
> bugs to fix, or several features to add, try not to mix those changes
> up in a single commit .
